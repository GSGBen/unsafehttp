          Unsafe HTTP

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/GSGBen/unsafehttp"><code>unsafehttp</code></a> is an extremely minimal HTTP server written in C
        from scratch, to practice C, *nix socket programming, and C compilation.
        It just served this webpage to you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, that's a marquee tag. Backward-compatibility is a beautiful thing.

      <h2>Hosting</h2>
      <p>
        It's running on a tiny Orange Pi SBC in my office:

      <p>
        There's no HTTP proxy between you, just a port-forward through my VPS.
        You're <code>connect</code>ing right to the socket that the code is
        <code>accept</code>ing on. 
      </p>

      <h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
      <p>
        To prevent user-initiated filesystem interaction, and to avoid having to
        worry about path cleaning, <code>unsafehttp</code> loads all content
        into a hash table in memory on startup, with the request/file paths as
        keys and the file contents as values. Servicing a request is simply
        looking up the content via the path. Any malicious paths
        <span class="strike">will</span>should then just fail to find an entry.
      </p>

      <h2>HTTP Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        RFC 9112 is a fantastic document that details the exact format of HTTP
        1.1 requests, how servers should respond to those requests, and is even
        written in a way that would make implementing a full test suite a
        reasonable task.
      </p>
      <p>
        This server follows almost none of that.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the interest of keeping this a fun and short side project, I've
        implemented the very bare minimum for browsers to be able to send a
        simple HTTP GET request to the server, and receive a response that lets
        them render a webpage. Again in the interest of keeping this short, I'm
        not even following the RFC exactly. Readers MUST NOT hold this against
        the project, and SHOULD use this as motivation to keep some of their own
        side projects fun and short.
